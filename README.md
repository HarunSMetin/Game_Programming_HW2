#### The 3 most challenging parts of this assignment for me:

  - Adding a health bar on enemies and changing the health bar according to the damage they take

  - Organizing UI objects to be user-friendly and pleasing to the eye

  - LRF Part


I tried to solve all these difficulties by watching tutorials on the internet and modifying them according to my own wishes.
